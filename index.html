                Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
                You don't know how lovely you are
                I had to find you, tell you I need you
                Tell you I set you apart
                Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
                Oh, let's go back to the start
                Running in circles, coming up tails
                Heads on a science apart
            </p>

                Nobody said it was easy
                It's such a shame for us to part
                Nobody said it was easy
                No one ever said it would be this hard
                Oh, take me back to the start

                I was just guessing at numbers and figures
                Pulling the puzzles apart
                Questions of science, science and progress
                Do not speak as loud as my heart
                Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
                Oh, and I rush to the start
                Running in circles, chasing our tails
                Coming back as we are
            </p>
